// Boolean Logic Exercises
// Exercise 1 Ternary Operator
// Write a program that takes an integer num as input and prints "Even" if num is even and "Odd" if it's odd using the ternary operator.

// Exercise 2: If-Else Statement
// Write a program that checks if a user's age is greater than or equal to 18. If it is, print "You are an adult." Otherwise, print "You are a minor."

// Exercise 3: Else If Statement
// Write a program that takes a numerical grade (0-100) as input and prints the corresponding letter grade using the following scale:

// A: 90-100
// B: 80-89
// C: 70-79
// D: 60-69
// F: 0-59
// Exercise 4: Modulo Operator
// Write a program that checks if a given number x is divisible by 3 and 5, both, and prints "Divisible by both 3 and 5" if true. Otherwise, print "Not divisible by both 3 and 5."

// Exercise 5: Switch Statement
// Write a program that takes a day of the week as input (e.g., "Monday", "Tuesday", etc.) and uses a switch statement to print a message based on the input. For example, if the input is "Monday," it should print "It's the start of the workweek."

// Exercise 6: Logical Operators
// Write a program that checks if a user's input for age is between 18 and 65 (inclusive) and if the user has a valid driver's license (you can use a boolean variable hasLicense to simulate this). If both conditions are met, print "You are eligible to drive." Otherwise, print "You are not eligible to drive."

// Exercise 7: Password Validation
// Write a program that asks the user to enter a password. If the password is "secret123", print "Access granted." Otherwise, print "Access denied."

// Exercise 8: Leap Year Checker
// Write a program that checks if a given year is a leap year. A leap year is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400. Print "Leap year" if it's a leap year and "Not a leap year" otherwise.

// Exercise 9: Logical Combinations
// Write a program that takes two boolean values, isMember and isPremium, which represent whether a user is a member and whether they are a premium member. Use these values to determine if they are eligible for a discount. If both isMember and isPremium are true, print "You are eligible for a premium discount." If only isMember is true, print "You are eligible for a regular discount." If neither is true, print "You are not eligible for a discount."
